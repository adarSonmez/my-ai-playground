    "## Why Scikit-Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the fields of data science and machine learning are vast, the main goal is finding patterns within data and then using those patterns to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are certain categories which a majority of problems fall into.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam and or not spam, you're working on a [classification problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification#Binary_and_multiclass_classification) (whether something is one thing or another).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict the price of houses given their characteristics, you're working on a [regression problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) (predicting a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to get a machine learning algorithm to group together similar samples (that you don't necessarily know which should go together), you're working on a [clustering problem](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know what kind of problem you're working on, there are also similar steps you'll take for each. Steps like splitting the data into different sets, one for your machine learning algorithms to learn on (the training set) and another to test them on (the testing set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a machine learning model and then evaluating whether or not your model has learned anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn offers Python implementations for doing all of these kinds of tasks (from preparing data to modelling data). Saving you from having to build them from scratch."

For example, you can shop for 4-door cars or shop for 5-door cars (which always confused me since where's the fifth door?).

    "\n",
    "1. **R^2 (pronounced r-squared) or coefficient of determination** - Compares your models predictions to the mean of the targets. Values can range from negative infinity (a very poor model) to 1. For example, if all your model does is predict the mean of the targets, its R^2 value would be 0. And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1. Higher is better.\n",
    "2. **Mean absolute error (MAE)** - The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values. It gives you an idea of how wrong your predictions were. Lower is better.\n",
    "3. **Mean squared error (MSE)** - The average squared differences between predictions and actual values. Squaring the errors removes negative errors. It also amplifies outliers (samples which have larger errors). Lower is better.\n",
